            <h4>Day 2</h4> After quick recap from previous day, we learned
            Python functions, file Input/Output and basic data plotting.
            <h5>Functions</h5>
            They are very useful in any programming language. These are ideally
            blocks of code which you can
            use repetitively. For example, following simple function will print
            "hello there!".
            <blockquote>
                def say_hello():<br>
                &emsp; print("hello there!")
            </blockquote>
            In above example, <b>def</b> is reserved keyword to define function
            in Python. <b>say_hello</b> is
            the function name. Also notice two brackets and colon in front of
            function name. That is way of defining function. Brackets
            are useful in passing some argument in our function. After that,
            you can write your logic. To use this function in our code, we can
            use it's name.
            <blockquote>
                say_hello()
            </blockquote>
            Remember to put two brackets in front of function name while
            calling it in your code.<br>
            Now we will pass some argument to our function. Arguments are
            variables which you can use
            inside your function.
            <blockquote>
                def say_hello_by_name(name):<br>
                &emsp; print("hello %s!"%name)
            </blockquote>
            In above example, <b>name</b> is an argument which we will pass on
            to our function. In Python,
            you can pass any number and any kinds of arguments into the
            function.
            <blockquote>
                say_hello_by_name("Rohit") #This will print "hello Rohit!" <br>
                say_hello_by_name("Guest") #This will print "hello Guest!"
            </blockquote>
            You can also return some value from the function. Way to do is to
            use <b>return</b> keyword.
            <blockquote>
                def add_numbers(num1, num2):<br>
                &emsp; return num1 + num2
            </blockquote>
            In above example, <b>add_numbers</b> function takes two arguments
            <b>num1</b> and <b>num2</b>
            and returns addition of them.
            <blockquote>
                k = add_numbers(2,3) <br>
                print(k) # Prints 5 <br>
                print(add_numbers(10,10)) # Prints 20
            </blockquote>
            Important thing to remember is that <b>return</b> statement should
            should be ALWAYS at the
            end of function. Any sentences written after <b>return</b> keyword
            will NOT be executed.
            <h5>File I/O</h5>
            Many cases you have to work will multiple data files. You need to
            analyze and visualize data stored
            inside them. With the help of Python you can very easily achieve
            this. Here we will specifically
            look at simple text based files. To handle specialize file formats
            like "xls", we need some special
            packages which we will look at next week. Simplest way to read any
            file inside python can be done in following way,
            <blockquote>
                with open("filename.txt", "r") as file_variable:<br>
                &emsp; print(file_variable.read())
            </blockquote>
            In any programming language, one has to open file first, then do
            our task and then close it.
            In Python, you can do opening and closing automatically with the
            help of <b>with</b> command.
            In above example, program will open <b>filename.txt</b> file and
            print its content. Notice <b>r</b> after
            name of file. That is called mode of file handling. Here <b>r</b>
            represents read mode. You can see
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23566951/5284595"
               target="_blank">here</a> to know about available modes and what
            do they do. You can also open in default mode by not specifying any
            mode. Once we open our file, we have to assign some variable which
            we can use as file content. In above example <b>file_variable</b>
            is that variable. <b>file_variable.read()</b> will read all file
            content. If you want to read entire file line by line,
            you can do something like following,
            <blockquote>
                with open("filename.txt", "r") as file_variable:<br>
                &emsp; for line in file_variable: <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; print(line)
            </blockquote>
            <h5>Basic Plotting</h5>
            Data visualization is important aspect of our research. Python
            provides very flexible ways to plot and visualize your data. For
            that we will be using python's <b>matplotlib</b> library.
            If you do not have it , please check <a
                href="https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html"
                target="_blank">here</a> for the instructions. You can use it
            like following way

            <blockquote>
                import matplotlib.pylab as plt # Import library<br>
                x = [2,3,4] # Sample data <br>
                y = [10,2,3] # Sample data <br>
                plt.scatter(x,y) # This will create scatter plot of x and y
                <br>
                plt.savefig("filename.png", format="png") # Save plot to file
                <br>
                plt.show() # Opens plot
            </blockquote>
            This is very powerful library in python. You can read more about
            this and few
            basic examples of different kinds of plots <a
